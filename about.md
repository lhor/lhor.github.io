<p>I am interested in studying the importance of microorganisms for environmental processes and how they shape and maintain our exceptional biosphere by developing and using genomic and molecular biological approaches.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li> I did a lot of molecular Biology and molecular cloning during my bachelor and masters thesis</li>
	<li> I've also done a ton of Nucleic acid extractions (DNA and RNA) from environmental samples and from extremophile microorganisms.</li>
	<li> I like to play around with these programing languages: Bash, R, and Python.</li>
	<li>...which I use for developing bioinformatic approaches: Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics /  Genomics / Phylogenomics.</li>

</ul>
